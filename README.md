Read me covering what the project is, and what it's for. and what it is NOT for


Hello riot employee, I firstly want to assure you, that the aim of this project is NOT to steal, profit from, or otherwise illegaly utilise the property of riot games. I will never host this server emulator for the purpose of 
running publically accessable league of legends games. 

This is simply so I can become a better developer, and challenge myself to create something cool ^^ purely from curiousity. While I will do my best to stay within the law, I am not a lawyer and may miss something.  If at any point something i create crosses a line, please just reach out to me on any platform, and I will address this ASAP


Thanks! --Nerkmind (Aka, Lewis) :)
